# Hohmann Transfer Calculator

## Project Overview
This project is a Python-based application that calculates the Hohmann Transfer, a commonly used orbital maneuver to transfer a spacecraft between two orbits around a central body (such as the Sun). The application is developed using Python and utilizes MySQL for database management, Tkinter for the graphical user interface, and Turtle for visualizing the orbits.

## Features
- **Hohmann Transfer Introduction**: Provides users with a brief explanation of the Hohmann Transfer orbit.
- **Calculations**: Allows users to calculate the time of flight, velocities, and ΔV (change in velocity) required for a Hohmann Transfer between Earth and another planet in the solar system.
- **Turtle Diagram**: Visual representation of the Hohmann Transfer orbit using Turtle graphics.
- **Fun Facts**: Displays interesting facts about the Hohmann Transfer and its use in space missions.

## How It Works
1. **MySQL Integration**: The program connects to a MySQL database where the distances of planets from the Sun are stored. The database is automatically created and populated with data if it doesn't already exist.
2. **Tkinter GUI**: The graphical user interface is built using Tkinter, providing users with an interactive experience to select options and view results.
3. **Hohmann Transfer Calculation**: Users can input a destination planet, and the program will calculate the necessary parameters for the Hohmann Transfer, including the time of flight, velocities, and required ΔV.
4. **Turtle Visualization**: The Turtle module is used to draw the orbits and transfer path, visually representing the Hohmann Transfer.
5. **Fun Facts**: Provides users with additional information and interesting facts about the Hohmann Transfer and its applications in space missions.
